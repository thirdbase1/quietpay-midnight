/**
 * Provides an implementation of {@link DeployedQuietPayAPI} by adapting a deployed bulletin board
 * contract.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The `QuietPayPrivateState` is managed at the DApp level by a private state provider. As such, this
 * private state is shared between all instances of {@link QuietPayAPI}, and their underlying deployed
 * contracts. The private state defines a `'secretKey'` property that effectively identifies the current
 * user, and is used to determine if the current user is the owner of the message as the observable
 * contract state changes.
 *
 * In the future, Midnight.js will provide a private state provider that supports private state storage
 * keyed by contract address. This will remove the current workaround of sharing private state across
 * the deployed bulletin board contracts, and allows for a unique secret key to be generated for each bulletin
 * board that the user interacts with.
